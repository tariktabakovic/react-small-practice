# Managing State
Counter Button
    Create a react app that displays two components: a button and a div.

    When you load the page, the div shows the number 0.

    When you click the button, the number increases to 1.

    When you click the button again, the number increases to 2.

 
Counter Button with different colors
    Modify the counter-button app so that when the number is even, the text color is red.

    When the number is even, the text color is green.

 

Multiple Counters
    Create a React app that displays a button labeled "Add Counter"

    When you click it, it displays a counter-button component that works as described in the previous exercise.

    When you click the "Add Counter" button again, it displays a second counter-button component.

 

Multiple Counters with deletion
    Modify your multiple-counters so that each counter-button has a "delete" button. When you click a counter-button's "delete" button, it removes that counter-button from the page.
